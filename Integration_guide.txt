Integration_guide
-Main authentication logic is contained inside project/auth.py.
-Sample templates were only used for testing.
-For all routes which only require login can be added with @login_required decorator. Routes not requiring login need not contain the decorator.
-Database creation might be an issue ( if at all then run app.app_context: db.create_all() manually.)
